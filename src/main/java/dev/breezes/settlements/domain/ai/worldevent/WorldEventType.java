/**
 * Typed, centrally registered event types for the {@link WorldEventBus}.
 * <p>
 * Each constant carries its own classification metadata ({@link ObservationType},
 * base importance, and per-behavior flags) to prevent perception, inference, and memory
 * compaction from drifting as new constants are added. Co-locating this data here is the
 * single source of truth; downstream classes read fields instead of maintaining parallel
 * switch statements.
 * <p>
 * The two boolean flags are intentionally decoupled so sighting events (ZOMBIE_SIGHTED etc.)
 * can be forceRemember=true without requiring seedWorthy=true — and conversely, an event type
 * can be seedWorthy without also demanding unconditional admission.
 * <p>
 * {@code selfWitnessed} marks events that have no single doer: every villager that perceives one
 * is an equal first-hand witness (the sightings). It defaults to false through the delegating
 * constructor, so only the sighting constants opt in.
 * <p>
 * TODO: the tuning fields here are provisional — identity, perception tuning, and wire vocabulary
 *  each want their own home, so this enum is expected to split once emission is redesigned.
